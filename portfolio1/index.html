                <h5>Asta is a fictional character</h5>
                <p> Asta utilizes a rare ability called Anti-Magic,
                    energy that cancels out mana. While Asta may not be able to cast any spells himself,
                    he does have the unique ability to nullify the magic of others. Anti-Magic can be used to defend against harmful magic,
                    and even cancel out effects like curses and magical trap</p>
